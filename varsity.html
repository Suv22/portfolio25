      <h1>
        with Love, <br />
        Varsity Memoirs
      </h1>
      <p>
        Varsity Memoirs emerged in the midst of a world confined by COVID, a
        world where students spent the most defining years of their lives
        isolated within four walls. As graduation approached, the thought of
        passing out on a random Wednesday, without the customary uproar, was
        unsettling. Yet, for countless students who had never even set foot on
        campus, the absence of such milestones felt even more profound. With
        uncertainty hanging over the future of physical campuses, the desire for
        a keepsake—something to commemorate this journey—became paramount.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thus, Varsity Memoirs was born. <br /><br />
        What began as an answer to the need for connection and remembrance grew
        into a premium merchandise venture that resonated deeply with students
        across Delhi. Its designs, imbued with sentiment, struck a chord and
        quickly gained traction. In a year, Varsity Memoirs served over 2,000
        orders, partnered with Lady Shri Ram College and DU Beat and grew
        totally through organic impressions. <br />

        Led by a dedicated team of 15+ students,Varsity’s exposure became a
        stepping stone for their career while their contribution led varsity to
        grow exponentially in a very small period of time. <br />
        Beyond the numbers, Varsity Memoirs became a symbol of resilience—proof
        that even in isolation, there remained a way to commemorate the spirit
        of college life. The journey, marked by creativity and connection, will
        always be cherished.
