        For Youth, By Youth
      </h1>
      <p>
        Founded by Medhavi and Shagun Katiyar (2020), For Youth, By Youth
        emerged in response to the disarray faced by students during the
        COVID-19 pandemic—a time when the usual rhythms of campus life fell
        silent, and the organic exchange of knowledge and experiences was
        abruptly interrupted. In this void, the initiative sought to restore a
        sense of direction, offering students a platform to make informed
        decisions and regain clarity in their academic and personal journeys.
        Through a series of mentorship sessions, peer-led guidance, and candid
        discussions on the realities of adulting—spanning career choices, mental
        health, and personal growth—the initiative became a lifeline for over
        2,500 students in just one year. In the face of uncertainty, For Youth,
        By Youth provided the tools, connections, and insights necessary to
        navigate a world that seemed to have paused.
