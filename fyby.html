          Founded by Medhavi and Shagun Katiyar (2020), For Youth, By Youth
          emerged in response to the disarray faced by students during the
          COVID-19 pandemic—a time when the usual rhythms of campus life fell
          silent, and the organic exchange of knowledge and experiences was
          abruptly interrupted. In this void, the initiative sought to restore a
          sense of direction, offering students a platform to make informed
          decisions and regain clarity in their academic and personal journeys.

          Through a series of mentorship sessions, peer-led guidance, and candid
          discussions on the realities of adulting—spanning career choices,
          mental health, and personal growth—the initiative became a lifeline
          for over 2,500 students in just one year. In the face of uncertainty,
          For Youth, By Youth provided the tools, connections, and insights
          necessary to navigate a world that seemed to have paused.
