        <h1>Cars & Cabins</h1>
        <p>Cars & Cabins began as a quiet, almost experimental venture—one of Medhavi’s first steps toward testing the idea of business as a force for social change. At 18, in the small town of Jammu, a simple car wash service became the foundation for something larger. It was never just about the business itself; it was about witnessing the transformation of one life. Employing a single individual, the project was a small, intimate story of growth. Through the acquisition of a new skill and the gradual building of a customer base, the employee found a new sense of self-sufficiency. This small act—seemingly simple—was a quiet affirmation: that even a modest opportunity can change a person’s life. And, in that change, a belief was solidified—business could indeed be the vehicle for broader societal transformation.</p>
