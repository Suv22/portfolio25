          Cars & Cabins began as a quiet, almost experimental venture—one of
          Medhavi’s first steps toward testing the idea of business as a force
          for social change. At 18, in the small town of Jammu, a simple car
          wash service became the foundation for something larger. It was never
          just about the business itself; it was about witnessing the
          transformation of one life. Employing a single individual, the project
          was a small, intimate story of growth. Through the acquisition of a
          new skill and the gradual building of a customer base, the employee
          found a new sense of self-sufficiency. This small act—seemingly
          simple—was a quiet affirmation: that even a modest opportunity can
          change a person’s life. And, in that change, a belief was
          solidified—business could indeed be the vehicle for broader societal
          transformation.
