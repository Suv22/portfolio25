        THE LOST ARTS
      </h1>
      <p>
        Born from a fleeting yet profound encounter with the artisans of
        Basohli, The Lost Arts, now Pinnakey House is an ongoing exploration of
        heritage craftsmanship—its fragility, resilience, and quiet beauty.
        Hosting these artisans at home back in 2018 revealed a practice that
        extended far beyond painting. The delicate brushstrokes, vivid pigments,
        and ritual of creation—each step, from sourcing colors in Jaipur to
        crafting brushes from squirrel fur—was not mere artistry; it was
        devotion in motion. <br />
        This was my first brush with India’s vast artisanal legacy, but with it
        came an unsettling realization: the tradition stood at the edge of
        disappearance, sustained by just twelve remaining artisans. <br /><br />

        How does one preserve a living history? <br />

        The Lost Arts began as an attempt to answer this question—to bring
        visibility to a practice slipping into obscurity. That inquiry continues
        to evolve through Pinnakey House, expanding the conversation to crafts &
        arts pan India, shifting perspectives yet staying rooted in the same
        pursuit: reimagining the future of India’s legacy crafts.
