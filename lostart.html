          Born from a fleeting yet profound encounter with the artisans of
          Basohli, The Lost Arts, now Pinnakey House is an ongoing exploration
          of heritage craftsmanship—its fragility, resilience, and quiet beauty.
          Hosting these artisans at home back in 2018 revealed a practice that
          extended far beyond painting. <br /><br>
          The delicate brushstrokes, vivid pigments,and ritual of creation—each
          step, from sourcing colors in Jaipur to crafting brushes from squirrel
          fur—was not mere artistry; it was devotion in motion. <br />

          The Lost Arts began as an attempt to answer this question—to bring
          visibility to a practice slipping into obscurity. That inquiry
          continues to evolve through Pinnakey House, expanding the conversation
          to crafts & arts pan India, shifting perspectives yet staying rooted
          in the same pursuit: reimagining the future of India’s legacy crafts.
