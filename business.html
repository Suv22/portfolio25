        <h1>BusinessStudies <br> The Cartoon Chronicles

</h1>
        <p>VBack in 12th grade, while everyone was busy mugging up business case studies and the nature of management, I thought, What if Fayol’s 14 Principles had punchlines? So, I drew cartoons—turning bureaucracy into banter, delegation into doodles, and case studies into something actually memorable. <br>
            Scripts were written, a website was built (because ambition knows no bounds), and I quickly learned that just because you post something online doesn’t mean the internet cares. But then—one of my juniors scored a perfect 100 and credited my work for it. That day, I realized something far more valuable than any textbook lesson: the joy of creating something that genuinely helped someone. And honestly, that meant everything.
