        <h1>Making Study <br />Business easy</h1>
        <p>
          Back in 12th grade, while everyone was busy mugging up business case
          studies and the nature of management, I thought, What if Fayol’s 14
          Principles had punchlines? So, I drew cartoons—turning bureaucracy
          into banter, delegation into doodles, and case studies into something
          actually memorable. <br />
          Scripts were written, a website was built (because ambition knows no
          bounds), and I quickly learned that just because you post something
          online doesn’t mean the internet cares. But then—one of my juniors
          scored a perfect 100 and credited my work for it. That day, I realized
          something far more valuable than any textbook lesson: the joy of
          creating something that genuinely helped someone. And honestly, that
          meant everything.
